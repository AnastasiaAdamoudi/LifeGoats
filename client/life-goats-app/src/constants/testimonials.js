Being on the mountain, away from the chaos of the city, surrounded by nature and other like-minded people, filled me with energy and gave me the clarity to see what's important to me. Returning to my routine after the Life Goats retreat, I realized I could see things from a calmer perspective. That helped me organize my next steps towards my life and career goals.",
